## About Ⓜ

Made for study, **[this application]()** was specially created with a database call **[Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br)**, with a server-side processing request (GET, PUT, DELETE, POST).

Also using **[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)** with **[.ejs express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/)** as a framework for it.
It was created as the finalization of the module of the Treinanemto Full stack Js course, as a closing of the module.
